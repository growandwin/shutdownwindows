# shutdownwindows
Simple python script to shutdown windows with a single mouse click. Perfect for watching movies from bed before you go to sleep. I use it every day, so I can fall asleep while watching movies on projector screen from my computer :)

Its like a "sleep" function from old days TV remotes, you just click one button that has the number of minutes after which your PC will close. 

100% mouse controlled. 

**just 2 dependencies:**
1. appJar (for GUI) 
2. pyinput (to automatically click ENTER when the windows system prompt about windows shutting down appears)

**To run it:**
1. download and install python https://www.python.org/downloads/ (i run it on python 3.9.1)
2. install dependencies: open your directory where you downloaded the script in CMD aka windows terminal, and run 
```pip install requirements.txt```
3. Make python the default application that opens .py files on your PC
4. Double click the home.py to choose when to close your computer. 
5. Make shortcut to home.py on you desktop :) 
6. Minimize the program after running, otherwise if you close the program it will shutdown at the desired time, but won't click the prompt that windows will push to front on top of your movie - reminding you, that in 10 minutes the PC will shutdown.
