# shutdownwindows
Simple python script to shutdown windows with a single mouse click. Perfect for watching movies from bed before you go to sleep. 

just 2 dependencies: appJar (for GUI) & pyinput (to automatically click ENTER when the windows system prompt about windows shutting down appears)

To run it: 
1. download and install python https://www.python.org/downloads/ (i run it on python 3.9.1)
2. install dependencies: open your directory where you downloaded the script in CMD, and run "pip install requirements.txt"
3. Make shortcut on you desktop :) 
4. Make python the default application that opens .py files on your PC
5. Double click the shutdown.py to choose when to close your computer. 

Its like a remote sleep function from old days, you just click one button that has the number of minutes after which your PC will close.
